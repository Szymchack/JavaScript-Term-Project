                "Horseshoe Falls is a scenic, privately owned waterfall in Munising. 
                There is an admission fee to visit the falls. 
                It is spring fed, so it may be flowing when the other five falls in the area are not."

                "The parking lot is located about four miles north of H-58 off Miners Castle Road. 
                The hike from the parking area to the waterfall is 1.2 miles round-trip.
                A gravel path through the northwoods leads to two overlooks. 
                Enjoy the Miners Falls Nature Trail and views of the Miners Basin along the way. 
                The Miners River drops about 50 feet over a sandstone outcrop, creating the park's most powerful waterfall. 
                There are 64 steps down to the lower viewing platform at the falls. 
                This is an especially beautiful trail in the springtime with abundant wildflowers."

                    "Beginning at the picnic area, a paved foot trail leads past interpretive exhibits to breathtaking overlooks of Lake Superior and Grand Island. 
                    Stairs and a steeper trail lead to the lower overlook adjacent to Miners Castle.
                    There are many things to do here, besides taking great pictures:Hike to the three overlooks, picnic here while watching for a bald eagle, hike to Miners Beach,
                    drive to Miners Beach, hike to Miners Lake.
