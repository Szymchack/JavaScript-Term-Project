Ocho's Excellent Adventures

Ocho's Tree of Delight
This game is a drag and drop to help ages 2-5 learn to pick things up with a mouse and drop them somewhere else on the page.

The directions are simple, pick up the different items and situate them in the tree where you want them.

Current problems are some of the items are not dark enough to be seen in the tree.  I plan on resolving this by making them darker and different sizes.

In the future I plan to make sections in the tree and more items such as furniture, applicances, and decorations.

Ocho On The Run

This is a gameusing arrow keys and mouse to move Ocho around the screen.  It is also geared toward the 1-5 year range.

One of the current problems is on the down arrow, Ocho will sometimes glitch and slide off the screen.  I want to set parameters and fix this.

Future generations of this game will be a maze to move through and more obsticles.

Ocho's Moped Adventures
This game is for 1-5 age group

Directions are to move Ocho through the dropping flies so he doesn't get knocked off the moped.

One of the problems is that the flies are not looking the way I want.  In the future I will make them more realistic.

future generations of this game will have music.  It will have Ocho actually falling off the moped and will include a diversity of obstacles.
